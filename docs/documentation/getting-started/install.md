# Installation

Before you start using Yarn, you'll first need to install it on your system. There are many different ways to install Yarn, but a single one is recommended and cross-platform:

## Install via npm

It is recommended to install Yarn through the [npm package manager](http://npmjs.org/), which comes bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) when you install it on your system.

Once you have npm installed you can run the following both to **install** and **upgrade** Yarn:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

## Check installation

Check that Yarn is installed by running:

```bash
yarn --version
```
